# bash scripting

- just a collection of me trying to learn bash scripting, and eventually actual bash scripts!

<details>
<summary>Bash Scripting Basics</summary>
helloworld.sh is a simple script that prints "Hello, World!" to the terminal.

```bash
#!/bin/bash

echo Hello World!
```

in which i instantiated as a executable
`sudo chmod u+x helloworld.sh`

boom! now i can run the script with `./helloworld.sh` as I have executable permissions now
